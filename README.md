# 🔬 Enhanced LAA -Net: CBAM + Restormer for Robust Face Forgery Detection

Presentation Link - [Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGoAiMCg9k/r0Z1bWFoJVnz2YbR27ZESg/edit)

## Overview

This repository presents an improved face forgery detection model built on **LAA -Net**, enhanced by:

1. **CBAM** (Convolutional Block Attention Module) — for robust channel & spatial feature refinement.
2. **Restormer** integration — to boost performance on noisy or degraded input images via transformer-based restoration.

These upgrades significantly enhance generalization across varied domains and fortify detection on noisy data.

## 🚀 Key Contributions

* **CBAM Integration**

  * Lightweight and modular attention blocks refine feature maps along channel and spatial dimensions
  * Boosts robustness against artifacts, noise, and compression by focusing on meaningful forgery traces

* **Restormer-Based Restoration Preprocessing**

  * Efficient transformer architecture specialized for high-res image denoising and deblurring
  * Serves as a front-end to improve detection under noisy or degraded conditions

## 💡 Why These Improvements Matter

* **Robustness & Generalization**
  CBAM refines features adaptively, enhancing reliability across domains.

* **Noise & Degradation Handling**
  Restormer excels in restoration tasks (denoising, deblurring), improving downstream detection in real-world scenarios.

Input Image ──► [Restormer Restoration Module] ──► [LAA -Net Backbone + CBAM] ──► Classifier
```

1. **Restormer**: Removes noise, blur, artifacts.
2. **LAA -Net**: Structure as per original implementation.
3. **CBAM**: Plugged in intermediate layers for attention-based refinement.

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Python ≥ 3.7
* PyTorch ≥ 1.10
* Other: NumPy, OpenCV, scikit-learn, tqdm, CUDA

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
